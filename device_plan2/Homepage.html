                Hello and greetings user, and welcome to Machine Learning. The purpose of this website is to help users figure out how to use their devices effectively. We hope to be able to tell you anything you need to know about your device! Everything from setting it up initially, to some functions that can vary from device to device. Hopefully we can help you with all of that and more!
            </p>

                Perhaps you have been running into troubles with running your PC well. Perhaps there seems to be a problem that you keep running into with your device, it keeps freezing, or you are having graphical issues. While we here at Machine Learning may not be able to solve the problem, we can tell you problems that a device like yours may run into commonly, as well as possible causes and ways of avoiding the problem. If you are thinking of switching devices, this is a great place too research up on some problems that device you are thinking of buying may have in the future.
            </p>
