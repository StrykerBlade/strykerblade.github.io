                Depending on the manufacturer, diffrent functions may be diffrent as well as how to access them. This section is dedicated to talking about a few of them. The HP Pavilion x360 makes use of the windows snipping tool. To access this you have to press on the start button on the taskbar. From there you can type in "Snipping tool", and it should be the first thing to come up. Unfortunatly there are no hot keys to access this faster. To use the ascii table use the ALT key, and type in a number from 000 to 255. An example of this would be typing in alt 234, which turns into the Î© symbol. The full table is in the picture to the right.
