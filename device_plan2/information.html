                            The HP Pavilion x360 does not have any major manufacturing flaws or problems. While Individual parts or devices may be damaged during the manufactering process, shipping, etc, the HP Pavilion x360 has no major design flaws. One of the major complaints about HP Pavilion x360 is the touchscreen feature breaking. However this is a problem common with all touchscreen devices, especially touchscreen laptops. As such this problem isn't unique to the HP Pavilion x360 but a limitation of some of the technology it uses. Due to weakness, if buying the HP Pavilion x360, make sure to be careful of the screen, as it is more susceptable to damage than it's non-touchscreen counterparts.

                            Depending on the manufacturer, diffrent functions may be diffrent as well as how to access them. This section is dedicated to talking about a few of them. The HP Pavilion x360 makes use of the windows snipping tool. To access this you have to press on the start button on the taskbar. From there you can type in "Snipping tool", and it should be the first thing to come up. Unfortunately there are no hot keys to access this faster. To use the ascii table use the ALT key, and type in a number from 000 to 255. An example of this would be typing in alt 234, which turns into the Î© symbol. The full table is in the picture below this paragraph. On windows devices like the HP Pavilion x360 there is an alternate way to access various ASCII symbols. You can access it by pressing Windows Start then typing in "character map". Doing this will bring up an enormous list of symbols you can copy from, which includes symbols from the ASCII table and more.
